## Hi there! 👋

I'm Matthew, a junior backend engineer based in Poland.

I build every project I can imagine — if an idea pops into my mind, there's a good chance I'll turn it into code.

My main tech stack includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with a few other technologies I'm learning, such as PHP, MySQL, XAMPP, and Node.js.

I’ve got a bunch of pinned projects, but my favorite is my TO-DO APP.

I currently have only a few public repositories, but privately… I probably had 40 more projects — but I deleted them.

If you're interested in the videos and courses I learned from, check out my portfolio on my website.

### Fun facts:

• I have a cat

• I enjoy working with a cup of coffee

• My hobbies: gym, basketball, building web apps, and improving my skills
